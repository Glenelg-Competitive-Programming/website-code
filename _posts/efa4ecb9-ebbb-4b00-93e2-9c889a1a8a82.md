# Glenelg High School Competitive Programming Club Wins 1st Place (Advanced) at Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest!

We woke up early Saturday morning to attend Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest competition, an algorithmic programming competition hosted by Lockheed Martin. After two and a half hours of intense algorithmic problem solving and just a bit of spaghetti code, we managed to get 1st place in the advanced division!




## ✨ Extra Stuff ✨

All of our Python solutions can be found [here]([https://github.com/Glenelg-Competitive-Programming/CodeQuest-2024), note that some solutions do not pass all test cases. The full problem packet can be found [here](https://lmcodequestacademy.com/).

Thanks, Lockheed Martin, for hosting such a great programming competition! Good luck to future competitors!
