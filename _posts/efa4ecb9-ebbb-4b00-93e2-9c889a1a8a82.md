# Glenelg High School Competitive Programming Club Wins 1st Place (Advanced) at Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest! 


Congratulations to our team members Kevin Hwang, Samuel Yoon, and Alex Chen for their outstanding performance! Early Saturday morning, they woke up to attend Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest competition, an algorithmic programming competition hosted by Lockheed Martin. 

For two and a half hours, the team engaged in intense problem-solving and developed complex algorithms (with a bit of spaghetti code, of course). Thanks to Kevin’s advanced knowledge in Python, Samuel’s exceptional problem-solving skills, and Alex’s strong math background, the team won 1st place in the advanced division! We are incredibly proud of their hard work and dedication! 

Thank you, Lockheed Martin, for hosting a great programming competition! We wish the best of luck to future competitors!
